Scripts and tools for Kantai Collection modding

The aim of this script pack is to pick up the slack of the official developers. A fixed resolution of 800x480px may be acceptable two years ago, but with the proliferation of high definition screens it has become a major distraction to our enjoyment. This game looks awful when scaled up, and as far as I could see there is no imperative from the developers to improve it. I hope this will improve player's experice and possibly force some changes upstream. 

This repository does not contain any copyrighted code or images without appropriate authorisations. Changes made to game files are done in a manner that is as transparent as possible and they should, in theory, not affect the communication between the client and the server.
